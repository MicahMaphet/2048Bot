# 2048Bot
It can play 2048 here https://www.2048.org/

To run install python
https://www.python.org/downloads/
And install the following in the cammand prompt
```
pip install pyautogui
```
```
pip install keyboard
```
```
pip install pillow
```
The bot does not press random buttons, it reads the board an responds accordingly

It works best if 2048 is in full screen. It may not find it if it is not in full screen
Make sure the mouse is not overthe board or any of the tiles because that could confuse it
